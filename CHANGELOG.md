# Changelog

All notable changes to Vera Open.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-20

### Added

- **Event Engine** — personality events ([PRAISE] / [IRONY]) injected into briefings:
  - Praise: zombie resolved, bulk completions, high-mention tasks done, pipeline advances
  - Irony: chronic tasks, missed deadlines, stale follow-ups, zero-completion weeks
  - Max 2 events/week, min 2 days between, state persistence in `state/events.json`
  - Persona prompt updated with event integration instructions
- **Feedback Loop Automático** — 4-layer behavioral analysis:
  - `vera/feedback/collector.py` — saves one observation per briefing to `state/observations.json`
  - `vera/feedback/tracker.py` — detects 5 behavioral signals (carga, prioridade_real, zona_morta, pack_irrelevante, ritmo)
  - `vera/feedback/patterns.py` — converts signals to inferences (rule-based, no LLM)
  - `vera/feedback/writer.py` — writes ONLY to `## Feedback loop` section of `workspace/USER.md`, preserves manual content
  - Minimum 5 observations before any inference fires, max 15 active, 30-day expiry
  - `vera feedback analyze` / `status` / `clear` CLI commands
  - GitHub Actions workflow: Sunday 17:00 BRT
- **User Priority Scoring** — `parse_user_priorities()` extracts keywords from USER.md `## Prioridades do mês`, boosts matching tasks +20 (max +40) in ranking
- **`vera packs` CLI** — subcommand group for research pack management:
  - `vera packs list` — table with install/enable status
  - `vera packs install <name>` — copies example YAML + enables in config.yaml
  - `vera packs enable/disable <name>` — toggles without deleting config
  - `vera packs info <name>` — shows description, status, YAML content
- **Custom Research Pack** — generic configurable monitor (`vera/research/packs/custom/`)
- **Personas rewrite** — "secretária executiva" → "operadora pessoal executiva", added event instructions with tone examples
- **Landing page** — getvera.dev on GitHub Pages with lead capture → Notion via Cloudflare Worker
- **`workspace/USER.example.md`** expanded — feedback loop section, calibrações ativas, domínios ativos

### Changed

- Briefing pipeline injects USER.md profile into Saturday/Sunday contexts
- `completed_tasks` collection moved outside `if weekly:` block (available for event engine)
- Inference dedup by type+target (stable across weeks, no duplicates)
- Task titles resolved in feedback signals (not raw IDs)
- Test count: 410 → 428
- Version bump: 0.4.0 → 0.5.0

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added

- **`vera setup` overhaul** — interactive wizard with inline validation at every step:
  - InquirerPy-powered prompts with typer.prompt fallback
  - Inline validation for Notion token, Telegram bot, Claude API key, Ollama connection
  - Config presets: "Recolocação profissional" / "Briefing pessoal" / "Teste rápido"
  - **Notion DB creation** — auto-provisions databases + sample records + "Comece Aqui" welcome page
  - Auto-detects timezone via `tzlocal`
  - Auto-detects Telegram chat_id via `getUpdates`
  - Auto-runs `vera doctor` at the end
- **`vera doctor`** — diagnostic command with 10 health checks:
  - Python version, .env, config.yaml, Notion token, database access, Telegram bot/chat_id, LLM, state/ writable, USER.md
  - Formatted table output with fix hints
  - Exit code 0 (all OK) or 1 (failures)
- **`vera/setup/` package** — 5 modules: wizard, validators, notion_setup, config_writer, schemas
- **Config presets** — `config/presets/config.{jobs,briefing,minimal}.yaml`
- `InquirerPy` and `tzlocal` as optional `[setup]` dependencies
- 55+ new tests for setup wizard, validators, Notion creation, and doctor

### Changed

- Setup wizard moved from monolithic `cli.py` (260 lines) to `vera/setup/` package
- `pyproject.toml` version synced (was 0.2.0, now 0.4.0)
- Test count: 359 → 410+

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-11

### Added

- **`vera research --all`** — runs all available research packs in parallel via `asyncio.gather`. One pack failure doesn't block others. CI daily workflow now uses a single step instead of three.
- **`vera briefing --weekly`** — dedicated weekly review mode with:
  - Completed task collection from Notion (cross-referenced with state for recency)
  - Weekly metrics: completed, open, new, zombies, briefing count
  - Structured LLM prompt: retrospective → open items → patterns → next week priorities
  - Works on any day (not just Saturday), triggered manually or via CI
- **`vera status`** — system health dashboard showing last run, task counts, zombies, cooldowns, research pack dedup stats, and source health alerts
- **`vera bot`** — polling-based Telegram bot that responds to commands:
  - `/status` — system status (last run, tasks, zombies, high-mention tasks)
  - `/next` — top 3 priority tasks (excludes zombies and cooldowns)
  - `/help` — list available commands
- `TasksDomain.collect_completed()` method for querying done tasks
- `vera/research/retry.py` — shared retry configuration for all research HTTP calls
- 16 new tests (359 total)

### Changed

- CI daily workflow: 3 research steps → 1 (`research --all --force`)
- CI weekly workflow: `briefing --force` → `briefing --weekly --force`
- Research sources import `RETRY_KWARGS` from shared module (was duplicated in 3 files)
- Version bump: 0.2.1 → 0.3.0

## [0.2.1] — 2026-03-11

Full smoke test: every bug found in the end-to-end pipeline was fixed in this release.

### Fixed

- **Notion 400 on select/status filter** — Databases using Notion's `select` type for Status fields (common in PT-BR templates) got a 400 error. Added configurable `status_filter_type` field (default: `"select"`). Set to `"status"` if your DB uses Notion's built-in Status type. (`vera/domains/tasks.py`)
- **Telegram SSL error behind proxy/antivirus** — `SSLCertVerificationError` on machines with intercepting proxies. Set `VERA_SSL_VERIFY=0` to bypass. (`vera/integrations/telegram.py`, `vera/cli.py`)
- **`.env` not auto-loaded** — Added `python-dotenv` dependency. CLI now calls `load_dotenv()` on startup. (`vera/cli.py`, `pyproject.toml`)
- **Windows BOM in `.env`** — Files saved as UTF-8 with BOM on Windows broke the first variable. Fixed with `encoding="utf-8-sig"`. (`vera/cli.py`)
- **Scoring returns 0 without embedder** — When `sentence-transformers` is not installed, keyword scores were diluted by a 0.5 embedding fallback. Now rebalances to keyword-only scoring automatically. Warning logged once. (`vera/research/scoring.py`, `vera/research/packs/jobs/scorer.py`)
- **`_parse_date` crash on int timestamps** — Himalayas and Arbeitnow APIs return unix timestamps as integers. Added `isinstance(date_str, int)` branch. (`vera/research/packs/jobs/sources.py`, `vera/research/packs/financial/sources.py`)
- **DeFiLlama `None < float` crash** — `raw.get("tvl", 0)` returns `None` when key exists with null value. Fixed with `or 0` pattern. (`vera/research/packs/financial/sources.py`)
- **Dead Reuters RSS feed** — DNS failure on Reuters URL. Replaced with CNBC Economy feed. (`config/packs/financial.example.yaml`)
- **GitHub Actions CI failures** — Complete rewrite of workflows:
  - Created `config/config.ci.yaml` (tracked) instead of relying on gitignored `config.yaml`
  - `uv` instead of `pip` for faster installs
  - `git add -f state/` for gitignored state directory
  - `permissions: contents: write` for state commits
  - Correct entrypoints (`python -m vera` not `python -m src.main`)
- **`config.example.yaml` field names** — Aligned with PT-BR Notion template (accented characters: Estágio, Próximo Passo, etc.)

### Changed

- Research pack example configs use broader keywords and lower thresholds for better out-of-box results
- Test count: 300 → 309

### Added

- `python-dotenv` as a dependency
- `config/config.ci.yaml` for GitHub Actions
- `VERA_SSL_VERIFY` environment variable for SSL bypass
